# Full Stack app boilerplate #
This is a boilerplate for creating full stack applications using React and Express. Created following a tutorial by [Brad Traversy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0t42xBIYIs&index=2&list=LLonK6UW11g8jbqKTEEF7PuQ&t=247s). 
## Instructions ##
The express code for using the database is in ```server.js```. 
For now there is only a hard coded array, but normally this is where any MySQL or MongoDB databases would be used. All client-side React code should be put in the ```client``` directory. 
## To Run ##
Run ```npm install``` in the root directory to install the Express dependencis. Then ```cd client``` to get to the client directory and run ```npm install``` to install the React dependencies. Back in the root directory, run ```npm run dev``` to start the server as well as the app.
